\f0\fs26 \cf0 The tribe has been at war for over two hundred years. For people leaving the area, news of the war is the only source of knowing their city is still there, half buried in the sand. \
The adult women wear their veils covering their right eye, to symbolize their leader who once fought just as well with only one eye. They fight with bronze blades, curved to ensure damage to their opponents. Many a man has bled out in the red sand surrounding the city.\
Calling it a city might be a bit of a overstatement. It was more like a collection of buildings, some huts and tents.\
The power went through the mothers, and it was the women who fought in the war. Why they fought, no one really remembered, but they knew they had to do it. Both to survive, and to defend their honor. If no one fought, they would all be dead.}
